# Running Nico Food Menu

This Project can be run by following the steps listed below

1. `git clone git@github.com:erickstm87/nicos-menu.git` <-- this is the ssh variation. Here is the link to the repo in case you would like a different method `https://github.com/erickstm87/nicos-menu`
2. `cd nicos-menu`
3. `npm i`
4. `npm run start`

#General Note. 
    - I may have gone a little overboard and created a Firebase Data store to hold the menu data. I will include a Screenshot of what the DB looks like so the developer can get an idea of what I was pulling from.
    - Very unfortunate but I could not get testing done first. My method would have been to set up a snapshot.
    - Please let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you.
    - I also didn't have the time to make sure all radio buttons were fulfilled before submitting the order. 
    - I have brought in Redux on projects before but felt this would have been too much in the time alloted so I settled for custom events. A little hacky but would work on such a small scale app
